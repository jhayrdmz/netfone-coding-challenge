The phonebook application has the following fields: name, contact_no. only.

It contains the following features: create, view, list, update and delete a contact.

Requirements:
- Use Laravel as PHP framework
- Use a Lighthouse package to structure/build your GraphQL API

Expected Output:

You API should be accessible through the `/graphql` endpoint

Your API should have the following schema (functionalities)
- `createContact`
- `viewContact`
- `listContact`
- `updateContact`
- `deleteContact`

Your API should also contain an authentication to access the endpoint.
